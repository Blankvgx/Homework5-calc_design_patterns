# Midterm: 2024 Calc - Mark Cedrick Villanueva

## Introduction

This midterm project involves the development of an advanced Python-based calculator application, highlighting professional software development practices. The project demonstrates the integration of clean and maintainable code, the application of design patterns, comprehensive logging, dynamic configuration via environment variables, sophisticated data handling with Pandas, and a command-line interface (REPL) for real-time user interaction. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the key components and their implementation within the project. This includes descriptions and links to the implementation of design patterns, the use of environment variables, logging mechanisms, and the application of exception handling techniques such as "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) and "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP).

## Project Setup

4. Install the required libraries.

## Testing Commands

- Run all tests with `pytest`.
- Run additional tests  with 'pytest  --pylint'.
- To test a specific file, use `pytest tests/test_main.py`.
- For linting and coverage, `pytest --pylint --cov` commands can be used separately.
