# Midterm: 2024 Calc - Mark Cedrick Villanueva

## Introduction

This midterm project involves the development of an advanced Python-based calculator application, highlighting professional software development practices. The project demonstrates the integration of clean and maintainable code, the application of design patterns, comprehensive logging, dynamic configuration via environment variables, sophisticated data handling with Pandas, and a command-line interface (REPL) for real-time user interaction. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the key components and their implementation within the project. This includes descriptions and links to the implementation of design patterns, the use of environment variables, logging mechanisms, and the application of exception handling techniques such as "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) and "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP).

## Grading

You are required to write a short description and link to your implememtation of the design patterns you use.
You need to provide a description of how you used environment variables and link to your code to illustrate.
You need to explain and link to how you are using logging.
You need to link to and explain how you are using try/catch / exceptions to illustrate "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) and "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP)/
Create a 3-5 minute video demonstration of using the calculator, highlighting its key features and functionalities. Link the video to the repository readme.1.
